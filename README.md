# Fetch Project

## Overview

This project is a take-home test from Fetch Rewards, a leading provider of digital loyalty and rewards programs. The task is to build a user creation form using any languages or frameworks, which will allow users to sign up for the program. React was chosen for its ability to create reusable components and provide a smooth user experience.

The sign-up form includes fields for the user's full name, email, password, occupation, and state, with validations in place to ensure that all required fields are completed. When the user submits the form, their information is stored in a database.

## Minimum Requirements

* Display a form with inputs for each field: full name, email, password, occupation, and state
* Allow a user to complete and submit the form
* Do not allow form submission without completing the entire form
* Provide feedback upon successful form submission
* Have its source code stored in a code repository
* Be hosted on the internet

## Additions

* Make UI more responsive to different window sizes
* Check if name has first name and last name
* Have the name be capitalized before submitting the form
* Check if the password is 8-20 characters long
* Check if the password has at least one special character
* Create unit tests
